# Data Structures

- Array: A collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations.
- Linked List: A sequence of elements where each element points to the next.
- Stack: A collection that follows Last In First Out (LIFO) order.
- Queue: A collection that follows First In First Out (FIFO) order.
- Hash Table: A data structure that stores key-value pairs for efficient lookups.
- Binary Tree: A hierarchical structure where each node has at most two children.
- Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary tree where the left child is smaller and the right child is larger than the parent.
- Heap: A special tree-based structure that satisfies the heap property (max or min).
- Graph: A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting them.
- Trie: A tree-like data structure used to store strings efficiently for search operations.
- Set: A collection of distinct elements with no duplicates.
- Matrix: A two-dimensional array representing a grid of elements.

# Algorithms

- Binary Search: Finds an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
- Merge Sort: A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that merges sorted subarrays.
- Quick Sort: A sorting algorithm that partitions the array and recursively sorts the subarrays.
- Bubble Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- Insertion Sort: Builds the sorted array one item at a time by inserting each element into its correct position.
- Selection Sort: Repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
- Depth First Search (DFS): Explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking in a graph/tree.
- Breadth First Search (BFS): Explores nodes level by level, starting from the root in a graph/tree.
- Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.
- Bellman-Ford Algorithm: Computes shortest paths from a single source node, allowing negative weights.
- Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: Finds shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph.
- Kruskal's Algorithm: A minimum spanning tree algorithm that builds the tree by selecting the smallest edges.
- Prim's Algorithm: A minimum spanning tree algorithm that grows the tree one vertex at a time.
- Dynamic Programming: Solves complex problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems.
- Greedy Algorithm: Makes the locally optimal choice at each step in hopes of finding the global optimum.
- Divide and Conquer: Solves a problem by dividing it into smaller subproblems, solving each recursively.
- Backtracking: Tries to build a solution incrementally, abandoning solutions that don't work.
- Hashing: Converts input into a fixed-size value (hash) for fast lookups.
- Topological Sort: A linear ordering of vertices in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
- Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm: A string-matching algorithm for finding patterns within text.
